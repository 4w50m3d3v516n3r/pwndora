## How does it work ?

Night Crawler uses a [command line interface](https://github.com/alechilczenko/Night-Crawler/tree/main/python_modules) to scan IPv4 address ranges with multi-threading.

Using sockets, it determines which ports are open and captures more information about the target, see the features section for details.

Each collection is stored in a database, and finally the deployment of an [API](https://github.com/alechilczenko/Night-Crawler/tree/main/flask) allows users to access the devices.

## Features

- ### Port Scanning
  Is a method of determining which ports on a network are open and could be receiving or sending data. It is also a process for sending packets to specific ports on a host and     analyzing responses to identify vulnerabilities.
  
- ### Banner Grabbing
  Whenever performing the intel-reconnaissance process during penetration testing or security auditing, we need to pay attention to the current web-server’s exposed               information.

  That’s where banner grabbing comes in. Banner grabbing is the act of getting software banner information (name and version), whether it’s done manually, or by using any OSINT   tools that can do it for you automatically.

  FTP servers, web servers, SSH servers and other system daemons often expose critical information about not only the software name, but also about the exact versions and         operating systems they’re running.
  
  For example, following is a FTP banner:
  ```
  "220 CONICET La Plata FTP Server ready."
  ```

- ### IP Geolocation
  IP Geolocation is the identification of the geographic location of a device, such as a mobile phone, gadget, laptop, server and so on, by using an IP address.
  This search engine consumes an [API](https://freegeoip.app) to get the locations in JSON format.
  ```
  "country" : "Argentina",
  "region_name" : "Buenos Aires",
  "city" : "La Plata",
  "country_code" : "AR",
  "zip_code" : "1900",
  "time_zone" : "America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires",
  "latitude" : -34.9314,
  "longitude" : -57.9489,
  ```
- ### Screenshot
  If it detects that a device has an HTTP service running, it sends a request to a [server](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron) and take screenshot.

### Modules Explained

### CLI Usage
```
usage: CLI.py [-h] [-s START_IP] [-e END_IP] [-t THREADS] [-m FILE] [--timeout TIMEOUT] [--screenshot] [--top-ports] [--all-ports]

Scanner for Internet-connected devices

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s START_IP, --start START_IP
  -e END_IP, --end END_IP
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Number of threads [Default: 100]
  -m FILE, --massive-scan FILE
                        File path with IP blocks
  --timeout TIMEOUT     Socket timeout [Default: 0.5]
  --screenshot          Take screenshots from hosts with HTTP
  --top-ports           Scan only 20 most used ports
  --all-ports           Scan 1000 most used ports
```
### Examples
Scan only a single IPv4 address range:
```shell
python3 CLI.py --start 192.168.0.0 --end 192.168.0.255 -t 500 --top-ports
```
Scan from a text file with multiple IPv4 address ranges:
```shell
python3 CLI.py --massive-scan Argentina.csv -t 200 --all-ports --screenshot 
```
